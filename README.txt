*DESCRIPTION ABOUT PROJECT -it is an application for a library management, which is very useful to library incharge to keep their records 		properly as well as students too.

	I am using structures to store may data for eg:- struct s_date, struct student, struct books, struct list etc. which will store data for date in dd/mm/yy format, student information, book information and list of books respectively. I have used link list to store all the data such as student info for modifying and delete or adding members data. In issue books and return books we are adding and deleting one book each time, it also asking for whole information about books for eg no. of book, name of book, author name, publisher name and stock of books.
 
1) it is giving you information about list of books, add books, issue books, return books.
2) it is also providing separate record for each student and their profile i.e. it will contain their information.
3) again it is also showing total no. of books available in library, book no., author name, issued/stock etc.
